| `npm install -g @angular/cli` | Installs Angular CLI tool | **Global** (you only do this once) |
| `ng new project-name`         | Creates a new Angular app | **Local** (per project)            |
| `ng serve`                    | Runs the app              | Local server on port 4200          |

choose stylesheet type to be SCSS for:
1.More Powerful and Flexible.
2.Better Code Organization.
3.Variables and Reusability.
4.Angular CLI Supports SCSS out of the box.

For tailwind integration follow angular tailwind installation docs.


to create new standalone components : ng generate component about --standalone/ng g c about --standalone (generates a standalone component called "about").



Great — since you followed the **latest official Tailwind CSS documentation** and chose **Angular CLI v20.1.4** with **CSS** as your stylesheet format (not SCSS), here’s a breakdown of how your project currently looks, based on what you’ve shared:

---

### ✅ **✅ Your Project Setup Summary**

#### 🧱 Project Type:

* Angular (standalone components)
* Tailwind CSS integrated via PostCSS
* Stylesheet format: **CSS**
* Server-side rendering: ❌ *not enabled*
* Routing: ✅ `app.routes.ts` with standalone component routing

### 📁 **File Structure (relevant parts)**

```
src/
├── index.html
├── main.ts
├── style.css               👈 Tailwind CSS is imported here
└── app/
    ├── app.ts              👈 Root AppComponent (standalone)
    ├── app.routes.ts       👈 Routing config (with 'tailwind' path)
    ├── app.config.ts       👈 App-level configuration

        └── tailwind.spec.ts
```

### 📦 Installed Tailwind & PostCSS Dependencies

In your `package.json`, you likely have these (you can confirm):

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "tailwindcss": "^3.x",
  "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.x",
  "postcss": "^8.x"
}
```

---

### 📄 PostCSS Configuration (`.postcssrc.json`)

Located in project root:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {}
  }
}
```

✅ Correct setup for Angular v17+ and Tailwind v3+.

---

### 🎨 Global Styles (`src/style.css`)

✅ Should now contain:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

This is what lets Tailwind actually work across your whole app.

---

### 🧭 Routing (`app.routes.ts`)

You’ve correctly set up routing like this:

```ts
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { Tailwind } from './tailwind/tailwind';

export const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'tailwind', component: Tailwind },
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'tailwind', pathMatch: 'full' },
];
```

✅ This ensures your app loads the Tailwind component by default.

---

### 🧪 Optional Git Info

* You noticed Git was initialized — that would have created a hidden `.git` folder in your project root.
* You can either remove it or link it to GitHub, depending on your needs.

---

### ✅ Final Check: How to Confirm Everything Works

Open `src/app/tailwind/tailwind.html` and paste this:

```html
<div class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">
  Tailwind CSS is working!
</div>
```

Then run:

```bash
ng serve
```

And visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) — you should see a big, bold, blue heading.

### ✅ You’re Good To Go!
