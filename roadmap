Full Roadmap: Secure Login System + Role-Based Access + Google Login
✅ You’ve already done:
 Angular + Tailwind CSS frontend ✅

 Express.js + MySQL backend ✅

 Backend APIs can send data to frontend ✅

🚀 Your End Goal:
🔐 User registration + login

🔑 Google login

🧾 JWT-based authentication

🔒 Protected routes and APIs

👤 Role-based access (e.g., admin/user)

☁️ Secure deployment (future-proofing)

🔧 Roadmap (All Steps You’ll Complete)
🔹 PHASE 1: Setup Secure Local Authentication
Step	Task
✅ 1	Set up users table with id, name, email, password, role
✅ 2	Install backend packages (bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, express-validator, dotenv)
✅ 3	Create /register and /login endpoints with validation and password hashing
✅ 4	Generate and return JWT token on login
✅ 5	Create /me route to return user info from token
✅ 6	Create Express middleware to protect routes
✅ 7	Create Angular AuthService to call backend, store token, track login state
✅ 8	Create login and register forms in Angular
✅ 9	Create Angular guards to restrict protected routes
✅ 10	Hide UI elements (e.g., “Admin Panel”) based on role

🔹 PHASE 2: Add Role-Based Access
Step	Task
✅ 11	Update Express middleware to check user’s role (e.g., isAdmin)
✅ 12	Create admin-only endpoints (e.g., /admin/users)
✅ 13	Use Angular guards to block UI/pages unless role matches
✅ 14	Show/hide buttons/links based on role (*ngIf="role === 'admin'")

🔹 PHASE 3: Add Google Login
Step	Task
✅ 15	Set up a Google developer account + get OAuth 2.0 credentials
✅ 16	Add a new backend route: GET /auth/google + callback using passport-google-oauth20
✅ 17	Use Passport.js to verify Google token and create/fetch user in DB
✅ 18	Return a JWT to frontend after successful Google login
✅ 19	In Angular, add a “Sign in with Google” button (can open popup or redirect)
✅ 20	Store the JWT and log the user in just like local login

🔹 PHASE 4: Add Security
Step	Task
✅ 21 rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse and validator to validate body data sent to the backend.
✅ 22 Add Redis caching to store user sessions.

🔹 PHASE 4: Security and Deployment (optional)
Step	Task
⏳ 21	Store JWT and .env secrets securely
⏳ 22	Enable HTTPS for production
⏳ 23	Add rate limiting or CAPTCHA to prevent abuse
⏳ 24	Host backend (e.g., on Render, Railway) and frontend (e.g., Netlify, Vercel)


Google Auth Setup:

Perfect! You’ve done an excellent job getting through Phases 1 and 2. Now let's move on to **Phase 3: Add Google Login**.

---

### 🔹 Step 15: Set up a Google Developer Account + Get OAuth 2.0 Credentials

#### ✅ What You'll Do:

You'll create a Google project and obtain the credentials needed to allow users to log in with their Google accounts.

#### ✅ Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to the Google Developer Console:**
   [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

2. **Create a New Project:**

   * Click the project dropdown (top left), then “New Project”.
   * Give it a name like `MahapolaAuthApp`.

3. **Enable OAuth Consent Screen:**

   * In the left sidebar, go to “OAuth consent screen”.
   * Choose “External” (for public users) → Click “Create”.
   * Fill in the required fields (App name, User support email).
   * Add yourself as a test user (just your email).
   * Click “Save and Continue” until done.

4. **Enable OAuth 2.0 API:**

   * Go to “APIs & Services” → “Library”.
   * Search for “Google Identity Services” or “Google+ API” and enable it.

5. **Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID:**

   * Go to “Credentials” → “Create Credentials” → “OAuth Client ID”.
   * Choose “Web Application”.
   * Set a name like `AngularAuthClient`.

   Under “Authorized JavaScript origins” add:

   ```
   http://localhost:4200
   ```

   Under “Authorized redirect URIs” add:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback
   ```

6. **Copy the Client ID and Client Secret** — we’ll need them in Step 16.

Let me know when this step is done and I’ll walk you through configuring your backend (`passport-google-oauth20`) in Step 16.
